# ðŸ“Š Telecom Customer Analytics & High-Data User Prediction

This project focuses on **analyzing telecom customer behavior** and predicting high-data users using Python. It simulates customer data, performs feature engineering, segments customers, predicts high-data users, and provides an **interactive dashboard** for insights.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- **Data Simulation:** Generates synthetic telecom customer data including calls, SMS, data usage, and recharge amounts.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates average monthly spend, usage ratio, and high-data user flags.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes distributions of usage, spending, and region-wise patterns.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Uses **K-Means clustering** to identify customer usage patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Trains a **Random Forest classifier** to predict high-data users.
- **Real-Time Simulation:** Demonstrates predictions for new customer data.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with **Plotly** and **ipywidgets** to explore segments, trends, high-data users, and top spenders.
